If you're looking for a winter escape that combines stunning architecture, cozy cafe culture, and vibrant New Year's energy, Kaunas is your perfect European alternative._

The historic City Hall Square (Rotušės aikštė) is the central point for celebrations. Join the crowd beneath the impressive Kaunas Christmas Tree and Bell Tower. The atmosphere is joyous, with music, light displays, and collective countdown.

**Parties and Galas:** The city's famous Laisvės Alėja (Liberty Avenue) offers numerous bars and restaurants hosting New Year's Eve dinners and parties. For a grander night, check out events at the Kaunas State Musical Theatre or larger hotel ballrooms.
