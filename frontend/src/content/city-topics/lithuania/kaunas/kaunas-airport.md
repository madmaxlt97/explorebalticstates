# Best way to get from Kaunas International Airport (KUN) to the city center.

_Kaunas Airport is located in Karmėlava, about 14 km (9 miles) northeast of the city center. It is further away than Vilnius airport, so walking is not an option, but connections are straightforward._

## 1. Public Bus (Cheapest & Most Reliable)

There is one main bus line that serves the airport, connecting it to the key spots: the City Center, the Bus Station, and the Train Station.

Bus Number: Line 29G (The "G" stands for Greitasis, meaning express, but it makes standard stops).

Late Night: If you arrive on a very late flight, look for Bus 29E. It specifically waits for the last scheduled flight to land before departing, even if the flight is delayed.

Where to catch it: The bus stop is immediately outside the Arrivals terminal.

Travel Time: 35–45 minutes to the center (Stops: "E. Ožeškienės g." for the main pedestrian street Laisvės alėja).

#### Cost: _€1.00_ if you buy a paper ticket from the driver (Cash only, exact change recommended).

#### _€0.70_ if you use the app Žiogas or Trafi.

Apps: Download Žiogas (the local ticket app) to pay cheaper rates.

## 2. Taxi & Ride-Hailing (Fastest)

Since the airport is a bit further out, a taxi is much faster than the bus, which makes many stops.

### A. Ride-Hailing Apps (Recommended)

Apps to use: Bolt (most popular in Kaunas) or Uber.

Pick-up point: Outside the terminal.

#### Cost: Approximately _€15.00 – €22.00_.

Travel Time: _20–25 minutes_.

### B. Official Airport Taxis

Taxis are lined up outside Arrivals.

#### Cost: Usually _€20.00 – €30.00_. Always ask for an estimate or ensure the meter is on.

## 3. Train (No Direct Connection)

Important: There is no train station at Kaunas Airport.

To take a train (e.g., to Vilnius), you must first take Bus 29G or a taxi to the Kaunas Railway Station (Kauno geležinkelio stotis) in the city center.

#### Verdict: Do not look for a train at the airport terminal; it does not exist.

## 4. Car Sharing (Self-Drive)

Lithuania has excellent car-sharing services that allow you to pick up a car at the airport and drop it off anywhere in the city (or even in Vilnius/Klaipėda).

Apps: CityBee or Bolt Drive.

How it works: You unlock the car with your phone, drive to the city, and park it in a designated zone.

#### Cost: Usually _€7.00 – €12.00_ depending on traffic and car model.

## _Pro Tip: If you are heading to the Bus Station (to catch a bus to another city) or the Train Station, Bus 29G ends its route there, making it a perfect connection. If you are going to a hotel in the Old Town, get off at "E. Ožeškienės g." or "Vilniaus g." stops._
