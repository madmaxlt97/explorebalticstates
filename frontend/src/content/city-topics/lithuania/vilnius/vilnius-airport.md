# Best ways to get from Vilnius (VNO) airport to Vilnius center.

_One major advantage of Vilnius is that the airport is located very close to the city (only about 6 km / 4 miles south), making transfers quick and cheap._

## 1. Public Bus (Most Frequent Connection)

Buses are the most reliable way to get directly to various parts of the city.

Best Lines:

3G (Express Bus): The fastest option. It goes through the center (stops: "Sparta", "Mykolo Romerio universitetas") and crosses the river to the Green Bridge ("Žaliasis tiltas").

Line 88: Goes directly to the Old Town ("Aušros vartai" / "Vinco Kudirkos aikštė").

Line 88N: The night bus, running during late hours (roughly 10:30 PM – 5:00 AM).

Where to catch it: The bus stop is straight ahead when you exit the Arrivals terminal.

Travel Time: _15–20 minutes_.

#### Cost: _€0.65_ (30 min) or _€0.90_ (60 min) if using an app.

Paper tickets: You can buy a ticket from the driver (cash only, usually _€1.00_), but this is being phased out.

Contactless: In newer buses, you can tap your contactless bank card at the validator (_~€0.90_).

Apps: Download m.Ticket or Trafi to buy tickets easily.

## 2. Train (The Cheapest & Fastest to Station)

There is a direct train connection, but it runs on a specific schedule.

The Route: From "Oro uostas" (Airport) to "Vilnius" (Main Railway Station).

Where to catch it: Follow the signs for the "Train Station" from the terminal. It is a short outdoor walk (elevator/stairs down from the departure ramp level).

Travel Time: Only 7 minutes.

#### Cost: Approximately _€0.80 – €0.90_. You can buy tickets online, on the train (cash/card), or at the machine.

#### _Note: The train runs roughly once an hour. It takes you to the Station District, which is on the edge of the Old Town. If your hotel is near the Cathedral, you will need to walk 15 mins or take a trolleybus from there._

## 3. Taxi & Ride-Hailing (Most Convenient)

Because the airport is so close, taxis are quite affordable compared to other European capitals.

### A. Ride-Hailing Apps (Recommended)

Apps to use: Bolt and Uber.

Pick-up point: There is a designated area slightly to the side of the main exit, often marked for "Ride hailing."

#### Cost: Typically _€8.00 – €15.00_ (can be higher during rush hour).

### B. Official Airport Taxis

There is a managed taxi rank right in front of Arrivals.

#### Cost: Usually slightly more expensive than apps, expect _€15.00 – €20.00_.

4. Walking (Actually Feasible!)
   Unlike many airports, walking is physically possible here, though not scenic.

Distance: Approx 5–6 km.

Time: About _1 hour_.

Route: You would walk along Dariaus ir Girėno street. There are sidewalks, but it is a busy road with industrial views.

#### Verdict: Only recommended if you are a backpacker with light luggage, the weather is nice, and you want to save money/get steps in.

### _Local Insight: If you are staying in the Old Town, Bus 88 is often better than the train because the train drops you off at the main station (Stotis), which is slightly south of the main tourist sights._
