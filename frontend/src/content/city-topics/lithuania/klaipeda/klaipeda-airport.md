# Best ways to get from Kaunas/Vilnius Airport to Klaipėda City Center.

_Since Klaipėda does not have its own major international airport, it is primarily served by Vilnius and Kaunas airports. Here are the best ways to complete the second leg of your journey to Klaipėda._

# From Vilnius Airport (VNO) to Klaipėda.

_The journey from VNO is longer, but direct transport options are available._

## Option A: Direct Airport Shuttle / Bus (Most Convenient)

This is the recommended choice as it bypasses the need to travel into the center of Vilnius. Companies offer services specifically timed to meet flights.
