# New Year's Eve in Riga: Celebration Guide

## 🎆 The Big Countdown: November 11th Embankment

The primary celebration takes place along the **_Daugava_ River** (11. _novembra krastmala_). This is where thousands of locals and tourists gather for the official city event.

**What to expect:** Live concerts by famous Latvian musicians, DJ sets, and plenty of stalls selling hot food and drinks.

**The Highlight:** A massive fireworks display at midnight, perfectly timed to music, reflecting off the Daugava River.

## 🎄 Old Town Festivities (Dome Square)

For a more traditional atmosphere, head to _**Doma laukums**_ .

**The Vibe:** The Christmas market usually stays open late on New Year's Eve. It’s the best spot to enjoy the "classic" winter magic with the giant Riga Christmas tree and the scent of gingerbread and mulled wine.

**Cathedral Concerts:** Check for special organ or choir performances at the Riga Dome Cathedral for a spiritual start to the year.
