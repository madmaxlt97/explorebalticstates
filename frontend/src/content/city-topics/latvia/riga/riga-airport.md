# Best ways to get from Rigas (RIX) airport to Riga center.

_Here is a guide on how to get from Riga International Airport (RIX) to the city center, including the best options, travel times, and approximate costs._

## 1. Public Bus (The Best Value)

This is the most popular and economical way to reach the city.

Bus Number: Take Bus No. 22. It runs frequently (every 10–20 minutes).

Where to catch it: The bus stop is located directly opposite the terminal exit, behind the car park. Look for the sign "Abrenes iela" (this is the final destination, but you will likely get off at "11. novembra krastmala" or "Autoosta" for the Old Town).

Travel Time: Approximately _25–30 minutes_.

#### Cost: _€1.50_ for a 90-minute e-ticket.

_Important: You generally cannot buy a ticket from the driver. You must purchase it at the ticket machine at the bus stop, at the "Narvesen" kiosk in the terminal, or use the apps Mobilly or Rīgas Satiksme._

## 2. Taxi & Ride-Hailing (The Most Convenient)

Taxis are fast and available 24/7. You have two main choices here:

### A. Ride-Hailing Apps (Recommended)

Using an app is usually cheaper and safer regarding price transparency.

Apps to use: Bolt (most popular) or Forus.

Pick-up point: There is a specific pick-up zone for app taxis (follow signs for "Car hire / Arrival 2" usually on the upper level, but check the app instructions).

#### Cost: Approximately _€12.00 – €20.00_ (depends on demand).

### B. Official Airport Taxis

These are waiting right outside the arrivals hall (Ground floor).

Companies: Red Cab, Baltic Taxi.

#### Cost: usually _€20.00 – €30.00_. Always check the tariff on the car door or ask for a fixed price estimate before getting in.

## 3. Tram (Not Direct)

There is no direct tram connection from the airport to the city center.

If you really want to take a tram, you would first have to take a bus or walk several kilometers to the Pārdaugava area to catch Tram No. 1, which is not practical with luggage.

#### Verdict: Skip this option for airport transfers.

## 4. Walking (For the Adventurous)

While Riga is walkable, the airport is quite far from the center.

Distance: Approximately 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).

Time: About _2 hours_.

Route: You would have to walk along highways and cross the Vanšu Bridge.

#### Verdict: Not recommended, especially with luggage or during winter.

### _Pro Tip: If you have heavy luggage, the Bolt app is your best balance of price and comfort. If you are traveling light, Bus 22 is excellent and safe._
