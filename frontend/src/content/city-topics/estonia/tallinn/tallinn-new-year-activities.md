# New Year's Eve in Tallinn: Celebration Guide

## 🎆 The Main Event: Freedom Square (_Vabaduse väljak_)

Freedom Square is the heart of the city’s New Year celebrations. Thousands gather here for a high-energy public event.

**What to expect:** A grand open-air concert featuring top Estonian artists (like _Alika_ or _Anett_).

## 🎄 Old Town Magic: Town Hall Square (**_Raekoja plats_**)

The Tallinn Christmas Market, consistently voted one of the best in Europe, remains open through New Year’s Eve.

**The Vibe:** Cozy and medieval. Enjoy traditional Estonian Christmas food, hot mulled wine (_Hõõgvein_), and the magnificent Christmas tree. It’s perfect for a more relaxed, fairytale-like celebration.

**Estonian National Opera:** Usually hosts a festive New Year's Eve Ball or special performances. It’s the top choice for those seeking a black-tie evening with opera and ballet.
